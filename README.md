## When Will Tioga Road Open?

For a few days each spring Tioga Road, the two lane highway winding through the highest elevations of Yosemite National Park, is open to cyclists with no car traffic once the snow has been plowed. It's a dream bike ride for an avid cyclist like me, but it's almost impossible to plan for. The National Park Service refuses to speculate on when they'll have the snow out of the way and the area free of high avalanche risk. This is frustrating and in need of remedy for cyclists who are relegated to figure out travel and lodging on a momentâ€™s notice. 

For this project I'll be diving into historical road opening dates in the Sierra Nevadas and historical snow data for the region as well. To learn more and read through this project, please visit my website: https://kyle-data-portfolio.vercel.app/when-will-tioga-pass-open
